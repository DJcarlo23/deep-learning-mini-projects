I created this project in order to learn and understand convolutional neural network for image classification. Its functionality is to decide whether there is a cat or a dog in
the given picture. A simple interface allows you to select a picture for classification.

To train the network I used pretrained VGG16 convolutional network which returns vector of 8Â 192 values. Then these values are used to train another network which is multilayer perceptron. Finally thanks to sigmoid activation function we get probability that there is a dog or cat in the picture.
